# USLM Schema #


In support of the United States Legislative Branch XML Working Group and in accordance with [2 U.S.C. 181](https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&title=2&year=mostrecent&section=181), the Government Publishing Office (GPO) is making the United States Legislative Markup (USLM) XML schema available as an authoritative source on GitHub. 



## Versions ##
The current version of the schema is in the master branch, and proposed changes to the schema are in the proposed branch. A major.minor.point structure is used to identify the version, and the version is recorded as an attribute at the root level. The point number is incremented to indicate a non-breaking change while the minor number is incremented to indicate a breaking change. Breaking changes will only be implemented after all other options have been exhausted. Please refer to CHANGELOG.md for a summary of proposed and approved changes.  



## User Guide ##
Please refer to the [User Guide](USLM-User-Guide.pdf) for additional information about the schema. A markdown version will be added to GitHub in the near future.
