# USLM Schema #


In support of the United States Legislative Branch XML Working Group and in accordance with [2 U.S.C. 181](https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&title=2&year=mostrecent&section=181), the Government Publishing Office (GPO) is making the United States Legislative Markup (USLM) XML schema available as an authoritative source on GitHub. 



## Versions ##
The current version of the schema is in the master branch. If there are any proposed changes to the schema, the changes will be in a proposed branch. A major.minor.point structure is used to identify the version, and the version is recorded as an attribute at the root level. The point number is incremented to indicate a non-breaking change while the minor number is incremented to indicate a breaking change. Breaking changes will only be implemented after all other options have been exhausted. Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a summary of proposed and approved changes.  


## Draft USLM 2.0 Schema ##
The proposed branch contains the draft USLM 2.0 schema; a schema review guide; sample USLM enrolled bill, public law, and Statutes at Large  files; CSS files; and additional schema required to validate the sample files. Additional sample files for the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations will be added in the coming weeks.
